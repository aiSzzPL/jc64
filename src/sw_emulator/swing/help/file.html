  <h1 align="center">JC64dis File menu</h1>
  <p>The file menu is dedicated to the project, and so have many voices:<br></p>
  <p align="center"><img src="./file1.png"></p>

  <h2>New project</h2>
  <p>To use the disassembler it is necessary to be inside a project, so creating a new one is the fist step to do.<br></p>
  <p align="center"><img src="./project1.png"></p>
  The project windows gives you the ability to insert:
    <ul>
     <li><b>Project name:</b> a name to give to the project</li>
     <li><b>File to disassemblate:</b> it let you choose the file that you want to disassemblate. Onve done, you will see the type (SID, MUS, PRG) detected and some information extracted from the file</li>
     <li><b>SIDLD memory flags:</b> this file were generated by some modified version of SidLength Detector wrote by Michael Schwendt and that myself patched into libsidplay in order to create such memory dump.<br>
         The idea were simple: let play a tune of a SID and collect if a given address is of a code or a data or never utilizated. With those flags you can achieve two important step:
           <ol>
           <li>Make at 0 to all the binary locations in SID files not used and being sure that the tune still play correctly. That file can be then compressed more better and I use a lot for saving byte in 4KB/16KB competition!</li>
           <li>Let an disassembler to know if it has to decode a part as of data or as of code.</li>
           </ol>
         If you have such files you can simple use <b>Add next</b> button to add one by one. If you want to reset the situation, just use the <b>clear</b>
          button or if you want a memory marked as all of code, than use <b>init</b> button.<br>
          Take present that you must apply the use of SIDLD with the function into the option menu
     </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h2>Open project</h2>
  <p>The function let you open a previusly salved project by read a .dis file.<br>
  Only one project can be opened at time, so you have to close the previous before opening a new one.</p>
   <h2>Close project</h2>
 <p>  This function let you close the current project to work with a new one.<br>
  If you had not saved it, you can still save it bebore closing.</p>
  <h2>Save project</h2>
  <p>Save the project to the current .dis file being in use.</p>
   <h2>Save as project</h2>
  <p>Save the project to a .dis file that you choose or create as new.</p> 
    <h2>Exit</h2>
  <p>This exit the application. Note that you cannot exit from the application using the X icon (to prevent you lose your works by a wrong click)</p>
