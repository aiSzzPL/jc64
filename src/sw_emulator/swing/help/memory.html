  <h1 align="center">JC64dis Memory menu</h1>
  <p>The file menu is dedicated to the memory area, and so have many voices:<br></p>

  <h2>Clear dasm automatic comment</h2>
  <p>During the disassemble phase, the Dasm engine is able to add some comments to common C64 memory locations used by the instruction being executed.<br>
    So, for example, if the address of an load/store instruction is $D400, the automatic comment appended to that memory area will be "Voice 1: Frequency control (lo byte)"<br>
    You can use those comments to easy search for some text (eg. "Frequency control"), however if you don't need it, you can use this menu function to erase the comments and leave them blank to all the memory location you had delected<br>
    Please, note that as soon as you will regenerate the source code, the DASM will add again that comment, so instead of erasing it, it silenty add a user comment (see Add user comment) that is blank as the rule applied in the engine is that a user comment is always used over a Dasm automatic comment.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Clear user comment</h2>
 <p>This is a shortcut function for make your comment to that location as blank (e.g you can enter the comment and modify it to be empty, but this fastest).</p>
 <h2>Clear dasm automatic label</h2>
 <p>The Dasm engine is able to detect all the memory location used into the program area and label them as "W" + the hex representation of the memory area.<br>
  This command will erase that association, but if it still present into the source it will be recreated at next Dasm source regeneration. So why this function is present?<br>
  The answer is simple: at the beginning all memory locations are not marked as code/data, so the engine use them as code (by default in option). <br>
  In this phase that could be a data area that if managed as code refers to a givem memory location and so that will be labeled. 
  When you will mark that area as code, the label is still associated, so it could appars when it is utilizated as data.
 </p>
 
  <h2>Add user comment</h2> 
  <p>This function let you add a comment to the selected memory area. The comment is used over a Dasm automatic one and in source appears in the line where there is the code.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="./memory3.png"></p> 
  <p>Note instead that a comment into the data area will appears only if there is a label and it will be after the label declaration (this let to merge more bytes to one row).</p>
  
  <h2>Add user block comment</h2> 
  <p>This function is essential for adding the right formatting to the source and appropriate comments to block of code.<br>
  The fist usage is for adding blank lines and so separating parts of code or data. The rule is simple: add a space (only one) and a carriage return (and iterate more times as you need). That char will add a blank line, otherwise you will gene a line with ; (a comment) that it is not good to read.<br><br>
  Here an example with data that are separated every 8 lines (so we have a block of 8x8 area): you can see the comment inside memort address $2040
  <p align="center"><img src="./memory4.png"></p> 
  <p>All other values inserted will be addes as ; and your comment, so for example, here a screen that show what it was inserted in comment and what you got:</p>
   <p align="center"><img src="./memory5.png"></p>  
   
   <h2>Add user label</h2> 
   <p>The user can add label to a memory location in data or code area and if there was a Dasm automatic generated one in that position, the user will be used instead of the other.<br>
   You cannot insert label with less than 5 chars and a option let you specify the max one to use (as some assembler has a limit in his length). <br>
   The program will search if the label was already present into the code, so you cannot create duplicates.
   As we had seen, Dasm generate labels only for memory locations inside the binary data, but a user can add a label even in the outside area (so as a constant).<br>
   This is for mark up external routine (like the KERNAL one) or memory area where to copy some code/data.<br><br>
   The engine of source generation processes the memory outside the binary data first, so block comments and label declaration will appears into the source into the initial area, then it process the internal memory area.<br>
   During the constant declaration even user comment are shoed:
   </p>  
   <p align="center"><img src="./memory6.png"></p>   
   
   <h2>Mark as code</h2>
   <p>The selected area will be marked as code (so color will be green)</p>
   
   <h2>Mark as data</h2>
   <p>The selected area will be marked as data (so color will be light blue)</p>
   
   <h2>Assign the selected address as +</h2>
   <p>In some cases, accessing a sequences of byte referring to an initial address (and so label) can improve source clearance, instead of creating one label for every bytes:</p>
   <p align="center"><img src="./memory7.png"></p>   
   Using this function you can create such relation: you need to positionate to the element you want to make point to another, then into the given table you can choose one address (that can have a label, but if it is not present Dasm engine will create one for it). At this point the label of this address will not be used and instead will be used the one that are associated with the offest for it.<br>
   You wil lse that now the RE column will have a + inside it and the tool tip will gives the address + offset.
