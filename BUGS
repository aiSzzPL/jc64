- The timing is not provided. Due to Java timing of a process is impossible to
  generare the needed (real) timing (a clock of 8Mhz). So, actually the emulated
  clock generates a tick only after realising the mutex to other threads. This
  means that in multi cpu this can produce sinchronization problems to the
  various threads.
  Note that actually cpu can't gives the real performance, due to Java slow
  velocity and the experimental implementation choosed.

- cpu emulation may contains bugs. These are due to c to java conversion.

- vic emulation are too young. Due to 1 to 1 implementation, it can be follow
  actively
